#+TITLE: Petalisp.linear-algebra

This library is inspired by [[https:numpy.org][NumPy]] and [[https:scipy.org][SciPy]].  It aims to be a collection of
frequently used scientific utilities.  All algorithms are implemented using
Petalisp lazy arrays and are therefore automatically optimized for any
available hardware.
